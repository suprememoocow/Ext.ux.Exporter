h1. Ext.ux.Exporter

h2. About

p. Exporter is a generic export class which takes any Ext.data.Store-based component (e.g. grids and similar) and exports the data in any format.

p. Exporter works completely client-side.  It uses a Formatter class to generate a document (.xls, .csv etc) and then redirects the user's browser to a data url so that they can view or download it.

h2. Installation

p. Download the latest version in any of the following ways:

* git clone git://github.com/suprememoocow/Ext.ux.Exporter.git
* Download from https://github.com/suprememoocow/Ext.ux.Exporter/zipball/master

h2. Usage

p. The most common use case for the Exporter is exporting a grid to Excel, which is as simple as doing the following:

bc.. var grid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
  store: someStore,
  tbar : [
    {
      xtype: 'exportbutton'
    }
  ],
  //your normal grid config goes here
});

p. The provided 'exportbutton' is just a specialised Ext.Button subclass which redirects the user to the generated data url.  If you want to provide your own implementation here, just check out the Button.js code (it's ridiculously simple).
